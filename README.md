Caliburn.Micro.Logging
======================
                       
Source code to the [Caliburn.Micro.Logging nuget package](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Caliburn.Micro.Logging).
See [blog post](http://buksbaum.us/2011/07/04/introducing-caliburn-micro-logging/)

The Logging library is compiled with DEBUG attribute set, so ALL message sent to the Debug logger will be logged.

Version 1.2 - 2011-07-05
  * Added GlobalAssemblyInfo.cs and VersionAssemblyInfo.cs to contain common AssemblyInfo attributes
  * Removed DebugLogger.cs from the Caliburn.Micro.Logging assembly
  * Added DebugLogger.cs to the NuGet content directory
